# amp-example


This repo is an example of an AMP Project.

AMP (Accelerated Media Pages) is a JS library that limits voluntailry HTML, CSS and JS functionalities to get websites simpler, lighter and bandwidth-friendly.

For example, it limits CSS animations, brings new HTML tags (amp-img permits to load pictures asynchronously), and limits JS DOM selection to the Qwery Selector.

This project is a responsive picture gallery with an image viewer. 
The chosen pictures are pretty large to see the asynchronous mode of Amp.
